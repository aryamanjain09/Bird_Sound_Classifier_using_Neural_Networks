# Chirpify - Bird Species Identification and Geolocation system

Please refer to 'github uploaded project report .pdf' file for details about the process followed and technologies learned during creation of the ML model.


# Objectives behind creation of the project

Chirpify - an application based on the ML model that:

1) Assists birdwatchers, enthusiasts and wildlife photographers in identifying and geolocating birds in their neighbourhoods/birdparks.

2) Uses the vast array of installed microphones at bird parks to identify bird species and display live location of birds (based on location of the microphone) on a dynamic map of the bird park. This creates an enhanced bird watching experience for tourists and an efficient platform for forest officials to monitor environmental changes in real time.
